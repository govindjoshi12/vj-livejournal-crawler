        Hello All,

        Greetings !

        I am Vivek Joshi from Bangalore. It was a nice long weekend. We celebrated Holi, the colourful festival, that narrows the gaps among hearts and spreads colours of love, harmony and fun.

        Feeling a little bad as India has lost to Pak in third test but Pak deserved this.

        Now, back to work. A few pending tasks are there that needs to be done. This week will be bit busy :)


        Current Mood: cheerful.
